# BrazilianTrafficSign
Implementation of a YoloV11 model trained to detect and classify traffic signs in Brazilian roads.

## Training the Model

To train the model, run the `train.py` script. This script initializes the YOLO model with the configuration file and starts the training process. 

## Testing the Model

To test the model, run the `test.py` script. This script loads the trained model weights and performs inference on random images from the test dataset.

## Debugger

You can also run the script in debugger mode for detailed debugging information using the launch options in VSCode.

## Results

Results are saved in the folder specified in <user_folder>/.config/Ultralytics/settings.yaml.
